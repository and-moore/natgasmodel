      This model is intended to represent the US natural gas industry
      through regional production and consumption, including pipeline
      imports from Mexico and Canada and exports via pipeline to
      Canada and Mexico as well as via LNG to non-adjacent countries.
       
       
      Prepared by Andrew Moore for the Fall 2019 semester of EBGN 632
      - Primary Fuels, taught by Ian Lange and Maxwell Brown at the
      Colorado School of Mines.
